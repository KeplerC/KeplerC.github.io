<p>Nothing to be said, for RSVP, please go <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAKEry3AgTk6K_lMWvswX7wdXzccqzKgeLZZ1qw-S5gPUwJw/viewform">HERE</a></p>

<p>I have already put everyone on <b>my wechat friend list</b> to database. For those who are not in my list, please text me +1(424)535-6503 or wechat ID cky237172056 to get invitation code. </p>

<p>Because I use google form, everyone's data is safe and there is no way hackers can hack my server(as I turned off password login). I will terminate the server and delete all backups when the quarter is over.</p>

<p>Also, I know the <a href="https://github.com/KeplerC/ClassUCLA.git">code</a> s*cks, but it works and I will not rewrite any part of the code. This is <b>just a tool for everyone</b> with and without programming experience, VPS, time to get things done. </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
