# Deep Learning 
## Week 1: 
Rectified linear unit: RELU 
from a set of input parameters, going through RELUs(neurons) then we get an output y

applications in supervised learning: from an input to an output 
* standard nn: real estate, online ad
* CNN: photo tagging, autonomous driving 
* speech recognition, machine translation: rnn

structured data: features are labelled 

detailed implementation see ipy notes
