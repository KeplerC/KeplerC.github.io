# Semi-supervised Learning(III): Graph Continued

|            | Inductive(generalize)   | Transductive(X generalize) |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| supervised | SVM, Max Entropy        | X itself                   |
| ssl        | Manifold Regularization | Label Propagation          |

Besides label propagation, there are other schemes based on random walk(modified adsorption), information theory K-L divergence(measure propagation).
