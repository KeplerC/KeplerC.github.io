# Wander Join: online aggregation via random walks 
by Feifei Li et al.

### Problem formulation:

##### Data aggregation: 

It provides approximate answers for online queries; Data aggregation is any process in which information is gathered and expressed in a summary form, for purposes such as statistical analysis. 

##### online aggregations for joins 

Ripple join: repeatedly takes samples from each table by RR, and every time new tuple comes in, join with all other tuples. 

### Wander Join

Build a join relation tuples and sample ![./img/404](./img/404). Then sample by picking vertex in R1 at random and random walk to R3: by using Horvitz-Thompson estimator, we might remove biased overestimate in random walk. 

With enough and unbiased sampling, we may get what we want. 

##### After

I am literally crying because I have reviewed so many papers. I am studying matrices/data with missing observations and I have reviewed for hundreds of related papers. I do need time to post them here.
