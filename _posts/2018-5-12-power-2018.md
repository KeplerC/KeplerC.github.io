The following blog tries to survey papers of Mobile Power Management. 

Never mind, a killer survey: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dac.3234. 

### Measurement:

Except HW Monsoon and SW power tutor: 

battery historian 2.0(by google)

https://github.com/google/battery-historian



### Estimation:

Application Processor(Multicore):online estimation of application-level power consumption. It has mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5.1%

(2017)

Power Estimation:

the difference between the measured data
and the calculated power numbers are very small, with all differences less than 18%

full-system simulator:  

it provides detailed performance metrics for an entire system.

26.8% error rate for various network packet loss rates
power modeling accuracy within 12.8% error rate

### Optimization 

stops RILD(LTE/GSM):https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7980184/ can reduce 42%

### Others:

Context Aware app profiling

 a self-adaptive framework that haves three power profiles that react to battery level, status and context
