### Spectral Clustering Brief Tutorial 

### Intro

Graph based clustering problems are treating clustering as graph partitioning. In this case, it treats cluster points using eigenvectors. 

Advantages

* good for sparse data
* don't make assumption on statistics 

### Matrices 

D(degree matrix) = d(v_i) for i = j, 0 otherwise

â€‹	which has degree of each vertex

Affinity matrix is i,j pair of affinity

Laplacian L = D - A

Spectrum Matrix is k eigen vectors of L with dimension N*k, N is dimension of eigen vector. 

After getting spectral matrix, we calculate k means in a much lower dimension

### Application

image segmentation, motion segmentation, image clustering etc.
