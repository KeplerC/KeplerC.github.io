	combine performance metrics to better capture underperforming sectors in mobile networks
		○ previous methods are combinations of threshold to determine/rank underperformed sector
			§ bridge sector KPI to reflect per-consumer QoE
			§ hotspot score: a combincation of thresholded kpis
		○ optimzation of correlation(score, ground truth) by PSO
			§ not differentiable 
			§ particle swarm optimization
				demonstrated below:(source wikipedia)
			§ regression:
				□ linear/nonlinear regression methods
				□  random forest regression
		○ dataset
			§ weblog/video
			§ ground truth: video loaded in Youtube
			§ better spearman correlation of the score between delay, throughput and stalls
