# DeepFix: Fixing Common C Language Errors by Deep Learning

It is essensically a multi-layered sequence-to-sequence NN. 

### couple of keywords 
encoder-decoder framework & 
sequence-to-sequence problem: a basic sequence-to-sequence model has 2 rnn: 
* encdoer: process input 
* decoder: generate output sequence 
the encoder and decoder are trained together. 

slacked gated recurrent unit 
energy value 
context vector 
soft alightment model 

### Pipeline

==
define a fixed size pool of name 
construct encoding map
mark the line number 
output:
== a sequence of tokens == 
Sequence-to-sequence model
    encoder map token to a real vector(annotation)
    context vector: weighted sum of input sequenced annotations with normalized weight 
    energy and weight determines importance of annotation
    decoder output result 

Program predict iteratively to repair multiple errors

Random thoughts: different token, then after repair, it repair the same mistake over and over 

### Experiment 
mutate up to 5 state from each correct program to introduce errors 

### Question
How does oracle decide 
### Paper to read
orignal encoder-decoder
