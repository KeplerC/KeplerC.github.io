# Survey on Mining Subjective Data on theWeb
by Mikalai Tsytsarau Â· Themis Palpanas

This is a review of Development of Sentiment analysis and opinion mining. It might be useful for extraction of logic. 

### Subjectivity Analysis 
The whole subjectivity analysis can be composed into three components:
* identify 
* classify
* aggregate 

for opinion mining, it is the first two steps; opinion aggreation is post-processing step. 
idenity: opinionative and non-opinionative phrases 
classification: distinguish postive/negative texts 
    problem: neutral & irrelevant categories 


#### Machine learning: 
1) learn the model from a corpus of training data (supervised, unsupervised),
2) classify the unseen data based on the trained model.
SVM is useful Pang and Lee(2002)

#### Dictionary approach: 
pre-build dictionary that contains opinion of words 
\frac{weight * modifier}{weight}
words can change polarity when in different context 

#### Statistical approach: 
Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI):replacing probability values with the frequencies of term occurrence F(x) and co-occurrence F(x near y):
PMI = log_2 F(x near y) / F(x)F(y)

and use sentiment polarity to calculate difference between PMI values against two opposing lists of words 

#### Semantic Approach: 
Wordnet 
Similar to statistical methods, two sets of seed words with positive and negative sentiments are used as a starting point for bootstrapping the construction of a dictionary.

### Opinion Aggregation 
The key is feature extraction and aggregation.
