<p>At initial condition, the nodes <strong>carry a label that denotes the community they belong to</strong>. Membership in a <strong>community changes</strong> based on the labels that the <strong>neighboring nodes possess</strong>. This change is subject to the maximum number of labels within one degree of the nodes. Every node is initialized with a unique label, then the labels diffuse through the network. Consequently, densely connected groups reach a common label quickly. When many such <strong>dense</strong> (consensus) groups are created throughout the network, they continue to expand outwards until it is impossible to do so.</p>

<p>First thing to note is that Euclidean distance is a good measure of similarity of graphs in this case. Adjacent pairs are similar to each other: if they are not directly connected, label can still propagate to there.</p>

<h3 id="community">Community</h3>

<p>A community in a network is a group of nodes that are similar to each other and dissimilar from the rest of the network. Community detection, which is similar to network partition is NP complete.</p>
