<p>Combining probability and first order logic into a single representation is a goal of AI. 
defintion: first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula</p>

<h3 id="key-words">Key words</h3>
<p>Markov network: joint distribution of a set of variables X = {X1 .. Xn}
first-order logic: a set of sentence/formula in first-order logic</p>

<p>ground term of a formal system is a term that does not contain any free variables.</p>

<h3 id="first-order-logic">First order logic</h3>
<p>a set of setences and formula
formula</p>
<ul>
  <li>constant: objects of interest</li>
  <li>variables</li>
  <li>functions: mapping from objects to objects</li>
  <li>predicates: relation and attribute</li>
</ul>

<p>Each possible grounding of a formula in the KB yields a feature in the constructed network.
ML,C contains one binary node for each possible grounding of each predicate appearing in L. The value of the node is 1 if the ground atom is true, and 0 otherwise.
ML,C contains one feature for each possible grounding of each formula Fi in L.The value of this feature is 1 if the ground formula is true, and 0 otherwise. The weight of the feature is</p>

<p>for MLN, 
given different sets of constants, it will produce different networks, and thesemay be of widely varying size, but all will have certain regularities in structure and parameters,</p>

<p>This network can represent any discrete / finite precision numeric variables. It can anwser arbitrary queries of transitional probability from F1 to F2.</p>
