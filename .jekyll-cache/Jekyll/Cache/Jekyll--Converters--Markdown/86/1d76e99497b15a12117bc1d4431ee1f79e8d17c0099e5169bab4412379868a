	○ previous methods are combinations of threshold to determine/rank underperformed sector
		§ bridge sector KPI to reflect per-consumer QoE
		§ hotspot score: a combincation of thresholded kpis
	○ optimzation of correlation(score, ground truth) by PSO
		§ not differentiable 
		§ particle swarm optimization
			demonstrated below:(source wikipedia)
		§ regression:
			□ linear/nonlinear regression methods
			□  random forest regression
	○ dataset
		§ weblog/video
		§ ground truth: video loaded in Youtube
		§ better spearman correlation of the score between delay, throughput and stalls
