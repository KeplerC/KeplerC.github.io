	○ traffic scheduling: ability to select optimal parameters and appropriate scheduling to obtain best QoS
		§ maximizing Mean opinion score(MOS) and fairness
		§ modelling LTE downlink scheduling with RNN 
		§ learn the mapping of QoE and GA to search for parametric space of RNN
	○ channel scheduling
		§ channel sensitive with QoS aware: user explore and send back CQI channel quality indicator, then eNB make decision
	○ have a mapping between status of transmission queues, channel quality, QoS, buffer state etc. to scheduling parameters like SINR, throughput, target delay, HOL delay what they have is RNN: input SBR,SM, delay, speed, # of UE, output is MOS and fineness
