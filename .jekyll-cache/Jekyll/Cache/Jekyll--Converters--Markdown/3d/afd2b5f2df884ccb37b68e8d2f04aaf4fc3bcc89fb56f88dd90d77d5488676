<p>encoder-decoder framework &amp; 
sequence-to-sequence problem: a basic sequence-to-sequence model has 2 rnn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>encdoer: process input</li>
  <li>decoder: generate output sequence 
the encoder and decoder are trained together.</li>
</ul>

<p>==
define a fixed size pool of name 
construct encoding map
mark the line number 
output:
== a sequence of tokens == 
Sequence-to-sequence model
    encoder map token to a real vector(annotation)
    context vector: weighted sum of input sequenced annotations with normalized weight 
    energy and weight determines importance of annotation
    decoder output result</p>

<p>Program predict iteratively to repair multiple errors</p>

<p>Random thoughts: different token, then after repair, it repair the same mistake over and over</p>
