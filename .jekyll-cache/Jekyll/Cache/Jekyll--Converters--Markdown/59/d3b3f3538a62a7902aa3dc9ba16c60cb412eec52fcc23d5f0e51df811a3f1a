<p>This is a review of Development of Sentiment analysis and opinion mining. It might be useful for extraction of logic.</p>

<h3 id="subjectivity-analysis">Subjectivity Analysis</h3>
<p>The whole subjectivity analysis can be composed into three components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>identify</li>
  <li>classify</li>
  <li>aggregate</li>
</ul>

<p>for opinion mining, it is the first two steps; opinion aggreation is post-processing step. 
idenity: opinionative and non-opinionative phrases 
classification: distinguish postive/negative texts 
    problem: neutral &amp; irrelevant categories</p>

<h4 id="machine-learning">Machine learning:</h4>
<p>1) learn the model from a corpus of training data (supervised, unsupervised),
2) classify the unseen data based on the trained model.
SVM is useful Pang and Lee(2002)</p>

<h4 id="dictionary-approach">Dictionary approach:</h4>
<p>pre-build dictionary that contains opinion of words 
\frac{weight * modifier}{weight}
words can change polarity when in different context</p>

<h4 id="statistical-approach">Statistical approach:</h4>
<p>Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI):replacing probability values with the frequencies of term occurrence F(x) and co-occurrence F(x near y):
PMI = log_2 F(x near y) / F(x)F(y)</p>

<p>and use sentiment polarity to calculate difference between PMI values against two opposing lists of words</p>

<h4 id="semantic-approach">Semantic Approach:</h4>
<p>Wordnet 
Similar to statistical methods, two sets of seed words with positive and negative sentiments are used as a starting point for bootstrapping the construction of a dictionary.</p>

<h3 id="opinion-aggregation">Opinion Aggregation</h3>
<p>The key is feature extraction and aggregation.</p>
