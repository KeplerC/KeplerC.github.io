<h3 id="question-treebank">Question Treebank</h3>
<p>There are often several text passages that contain an answer, so if the parser does not produce a sufficiently good parse tree for some of the answer sentences, there‚Äôs still a good chance that the question can be answered correctly based on other sentences containing the answer.</p>

<p>Parsing is highly dependent on difference between training corpus and application text. We have to expect a lower accuracy for parsing questions than for parsing declarative sentences.</p>

<h3 id="qa-typeqtarget">QA Type(Qtarget)</h3>
<p>it identifies type of the question as target. 
Our paper saves a lot of this part, because catogories like ‚Äúwhy‚Äù takes a lot of answer types.</p>

<p>For example, for quantity, it is hierachical that 
quantity</p>
<ul>
  <li>energy quantity</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>spatial-quantity
        <ul>
          <li>distance</li>
          <li>area</li>
          <li>volume</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
